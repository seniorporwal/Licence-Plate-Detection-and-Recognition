•The objective of this project is to detect, read and display vehicle plate number for traffic and security purposes.
•This project is based on EasyOCR and YOLOv8 technologies.
• Overcame computational limitations through Google Colab’s GPU access, reducing training time by 40% and enabling rapid model iteration.
• Processed up to 500 images per minute with optimized pre-processing and efficient model deployment.
